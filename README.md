## About The Project

- I developed this website by myself.
- I designed this website with [Eren Çibuk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eren-%C3%A7%C4%B1buk-883333198) and [Ayçanur Betül Çelebi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aycanurbetulcelebi). Also I would like to thank [Cevahir Sena Esenboğa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cevahir-sena-esenboga/) and [Yusuf Yılmaz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yusuf-yilmaz0/) for their valuable comments.
- I used React and styled-components for css. 
- I get the icons from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
- I imported the font families from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). I used Russo One and Manrope.
